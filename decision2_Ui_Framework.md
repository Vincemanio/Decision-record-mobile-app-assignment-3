# Choosing Framework for the retail Company


## Status
Proposed

## Context
As we begin work on a new mobile app for the retail company, it is critical that we select a User Interface (UI) framework. This decision is motivated by the need to identify the framework that will be best suited for developing a user-friendly and consistent user interface throughout the app. The user interface framework will be critical in ensuring that the app is visually appealing, easy to use, and consistent with the brand's identity.

## Decision
We have decided to use react native as the framework for our mobile application.

## Consequences
This approach has the advantage of allowing for faster development with a single codebase, as well as easier maintenance. It may, however, have some limitations in terms of platform-specific design elements and performance for extremely resource-intensive apps.
