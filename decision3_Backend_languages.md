# choosing the backend language for this retail company mobile application 

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The choice of backend languages is critical in the development of a new mobile app for the retail company. The choice of backend languages has a significant impact on the app's server-side components' scalability, performance, and maintainability. This decision was made to address a wide range of requirements, including offline mode support, push notifications, payment gateway integration, user behavior tracking, image storage, and internationalization.

## Decision
We chose Node.js as the backend programming language for this retail mobile application because it is event-driven and non-blocking, making it ideal for real-time features like push notifications. It can handle WebSocket connections efficiently and provide users with real-time updates.

## Consequences
Using Node.js exclusively ensures a consistent development environment, which can improve developer collaboration. However, it's important to keep in mind that using Node.js exclusively may increase server load during data synchronization, payment gateway integration, and image optimization tasks. These tasks may benefit from language-specific strengths, but Node.js can handle them effectively with careful design and optimization.
