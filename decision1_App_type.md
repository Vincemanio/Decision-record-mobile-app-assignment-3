# Choosing App Type for retail Company

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The central issue in developing a new mobile app for a retail company is deciding on the best app development approach. The need to decide whether to build a native app, a web app, or a hybrid app drives this decision. Each approach has advantages and disadvantages, and the choice will have a significant impact on the project's scope, development effort, and potential reach. 

## Decision
We have decided to create a native mobile application.

## Consequences
Creating native iOS and Android apps using platform-specific languages and development tools. This method provides the benefit of optimized performance as well as access to platform-specific features. It provides a consistent user experience across platforms, but requires more development time and money to maintain two separate codebases. Separate updates for iOS and Android are also required for maintenance.
