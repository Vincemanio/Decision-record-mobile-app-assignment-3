# permission 

## Status
Proposed

## Context
Offline mode, push notifications, payment gateways, user behavior tracking, and internationalization are all included in the development of a new mobile app for the retail company. It is critical to consider how permissions will be managed within the app to ensure a seamless user experience and to address these diverse requirements. The need to strike a balance between functionality and user privacy, as well as to comply with platform-specific requirements and user expectations, is driving this decision.

## Decision
We chose platform-standard permissions because it requests and manages essential permissions through platform-specific permission systems. When accessing device features such as the camera or location, for example, the app should adhere to the permissions model defined by the iOS and Android platforms. This ensures that users are prompted to grant permissions as needed and that they have control over their data.

## Consequences
The app can build trust with users and respect their privacy preferences by implementing fine-grained permissions and prioritizing transparency and consent. This can result in increased user satisfaction and retention. Furthermore, the structured approach assists in ensuring that the app complies with relevant data protection regulations, lowering the risk of legal issues and penalties.
