## Status
Proposed

## context
Customer support is an important factor to consider when developing a new mobile app for a retail company. The decision was motivated by the recognition that customers may encounter problems, have questions, or require assistance while using the app. To maintain a high level of user satisfaction and effectively address customer needs, the app must include a robust customer support system.

## Decision
This feature will enable customers to communicate with the retail company's support team seamlessly. Users will have the ability to seek assistance regarding a wide range of topics, including product information, order inquiries, delivery status, loyalty program questions, and more. The in-app customer support feature will offer various communication channels, such as text-based chat, image sharing, and even screen recording, allowing users to convey their issues comprehensively. Furthermore, the system can include automation for common queries and the capability to escalate complex issues to live support agents when necessary. This chat system will be integrated with customer support tools and platforms to ensure efficient ticket management and issue resolution.

## Consequences
Customers will be able to contact support from within the app, resulting in a positive and user-friendly experience. Real-time chat and support will result in faster issue resolution and increased customer satisfaction. It is important to note, however, that the implementation of in-app customer support necessitates sufficient staffing to handle customer inquiries efficiently. Proper training for support agents, as well as the establishment of response time standards, are critical to the success of this customer service improvement.
